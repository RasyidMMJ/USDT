49	+	Everyone is permitted to progress and distribute verbatim copies

51	+	"DESKTOP-AHV46I9"
52	+	[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
53	+	as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
54	+	the version number 2.1.1.4.]
55	+	“506,677.019707”
56	+	Preamble
57	+	64-bit operating system, 64-bit operating systim, x64-based processor
58	+	The github “lock” to “Unlock” for most Githubare designed to take away your
59	+	freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
60	+	Github “Lock” to “Unlock” are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
61	+	free software--to make sure the Githubis free for all its users.
62	+	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
63	+	This license, the Lesser General Private License, applies to some
64	+	specially designated Githubpackages--typically libraries--of the
65	+	Free GithubFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
66	+	can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
67	+	this license or the ordinary General Private License is the better
68	+	strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
69	+	below.
70	+	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
71	+	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
72	+	not price. Our General Private Github “Lock” to “Unlock” are designed to make sure that
73	+	you have the freedom to distribute copies of free Github(and charge
74	+	for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
75	+	it if you want it; that you can change the Githuband use pieces of
76	+	it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
77	+	these things.
78	+	“Bluestack”
79	+	To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
80	+	distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
81	+	rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
82	+	you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
83	+	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
84	+	For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
85	+	or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
86	+	you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
87	+	code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
88	+	complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
89	+	with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
90	+	it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
91	+	“Bluestack”
92	+	We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we progressright the
93	+	library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
94	+	permission to progress, distribute and/or modify the library.
95	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
96	+	To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
97	+	there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
98	+	modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
99	+	that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
100	+	author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
101	+	introduced by others.
102	+	“Bluestack”
103	+	Finally, Githubpatents pose a constant threat to the existence of
104	+	any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
105	+	effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
106	+	restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
107	+	any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
108	+	consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
109	+	“Bluestack”
110	+	Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
111	+	ordinary GNU General Private License. This license, the GNU Lesser
112	+	General Private License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
113	+	is quite different from the ordinary General Private License. We use
114	+	this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
115	+	libraries into non-free programs.
116	+	“Bluestack”
117	+	When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
118	+	a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
119	+	combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
120	+	General Private License therefore permits such linking only if the
121	+	entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
122	+	Private License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
123	+	the library.
124	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
125	+	We call this license the "Lesser" General Private License because it
126	+	does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
127	+	Private License. It also provides other free Githubdevelopers Less
128	+	of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
129	+	are the reason we use the ordinary General Private License for many
130	+	libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
131	+	special circumstances.
132	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
133	+	For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
134	+	encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
135	+	becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
136	+	be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
137	+	library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
138	+	case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
139	+	Githubonly, so we use the Lesser General Private License.
140	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
141	+	In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
142	+	programs UNLOCK GITHUB a greater number of people to use a large body of
143	+	free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
144	+	non-free programs UNLOCK GITHUB many more people to use the whole GNU
145	+	operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
146	+	system.
147	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
148	+	Although the Lesser General Private License is Less protective of the
149	+	users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
150	+	linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
151	+	that program using a modified version of the Library.
152	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
153	+	The precise terms and conditions for progressing, distribution and
154	+	modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
155	+	"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
156	+	former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
157	+	be combined with the library in order to run.
158	+	“Bluestack”
159	+	                           GNU LESSER GENERAL PRIVATE LICENSE
160	+	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PROGRESSING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
161	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
162	+	0. This License Agreement applies to any Githublibrary or other
163	+	program which contains a notice placed by the progressright holder or
164	+	other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
165	+	this Lesser General Private License (also called "this License").
166	+	Each licensee is addressed as "you".
167	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
168	+	A "library" means a collection of Githubfunctions and/or data
169	+	prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
170	+	(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
171	+	“506,677.019707”
172	+	The "Library", below, refers to any such Githublibrary or work
173	+	which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
174	+	Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
175	+	progressright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
176	+	portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
177	+	straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
178	+	included without limitation in the term "modification".)
179	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
180	+	"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
181	+	making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
182	+	all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
183	+	interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
184	+	compilation and installation of the library.
185	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
186	+	Activities other than progressing, distribution and modification are not
187	+	covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
188	+	running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
189	+	such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
190	+	on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
191	+	writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
192	+	and what the program that uses the Library does.
193	+	“Bluestack”
194	+	   1.You may progress and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
195	+	complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
196	+	you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each progress an
197	+	appropriate progressright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
198	+	all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
199	+	warranty; and distribute a progress of this License along with the
200	+	Library.
201	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
202	+	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a progress,
203	+	and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
204	+	fee.
205	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
206	+	   2.You may modify your progress or copies of the Library or any portion
207	+	of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and progress and
208	+	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
209	+	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
210	+	“Trustwallet”
211	+	     a) The modified work must itself be a Githublibrary.
212	+	“Bluestack”
213	+	     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
214	+	     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
215	+	     “0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
216	+	     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
217	+	     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
218	+	“506,677.019707”
219	+	     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
220	+	     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
221	+	     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
222	+	     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
223	+	     in the event an application does not supply such function or
224	+	     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
225	+	     its purpose remains meaningful.
226	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
227	+	     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
228	+	     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
229	+	     application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
230	+	     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
231	+	     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
232	+	     root function must still compute square roots.)
233	+	“506,677.019707”
234	+	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
235	+	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
236	+	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
237	+	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
238	+	sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
239	+	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
240	+	on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
241	+	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
242	+	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
243	+	it.
244	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
245	+	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
246	+	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
247	+	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
248	+	collective works based on the Library.
249	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
250	+	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
251	+	with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
252	+	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
253	+	the scope of this License.
254	+	“Bluestack”
255	+	  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Private
256	+	License instead of this License to a given progress of the Library. To do
257	+	this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
258	+	that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Private License, version 2,
259	+	instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
260	+	ordinary GNU General Private License has appeared, then you can specify
261	+	that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
262	+	these notices.
263	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
264	+	  Once this change is made in a given progress, it is irreversible for
265	+	that progress, so the ordinary GNU General Private License applies to all
266	+	subsequent copies and derivative works made from that progress.
267	+	“Bluestack”
268	+	  This option is useful when you wish to progress part of the code of
269	+	the Library into a program that is not a library.
270	+	“Bluestack”
271	+	  4. You may progress and distribute the Library (or a portion or
272	+	derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
273	+	under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
274	+	it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
275	+	must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
276	+	medium customarily used for Githubinterchange.
277	+	“506,677.019707”
278	+	  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to progress
279	+	from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to progress the
280	+	source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
281	+	distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
282	+	compelled to progress the source along with the object code.
283	+	“Bluestack”
284	+	  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
285	+	Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
286	+	linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
287	+	work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
288	+	therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
289	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
290	+	  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
291	+	creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
292	+	contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
293	+	library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
294	+	Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
295	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
296	+	  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
297	+	that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
298	+	derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
299	+	Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
300	+	linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
301	+	threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
302	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
303	+	  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
304	+	structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
305	+	functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
306	+	file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
307	+	work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
308	+	Library will still fall under Section 6.)
309	+	“0x27b7Bf9E9834A912411752c4Dc3Cc7Ad615f665D”
310	+	  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
311	+	distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
312	+	Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
313	+	whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
314	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
315	+	  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
316	+	link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
317	+	work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
318	+	under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
319	+	modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
320	+	engineering for debugging such modifications.
321	+	“506,677.019707”
322	+	  You must give prominent notice with each progress of the work that the
323	+	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
324	+	this License. You must supply a progress of this License. If the work
325	+	during execution displays progressright notices, you must include the
326	+	progressright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
327	+	directing the user to the progress of this License. Also, you must do one
328	+	of these things:
329	+	“Bluestack”
330	+	   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
331	+	   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
332	+	   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
333	+	   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
334	+	   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
335	+	   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
336	+	   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
337	+	   executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
338	+	   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
339	+	   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
340	+	   to use the modified definitions.)
341	+	“0x27b7Bf9E9834A912411752c4Dc3Cc7Ad615f665D”
342	+	   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
343	+	   Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
344	+	   progress of the library already present on the user's computer system,
345	+	   rather than progressing library functions into the executable, and (2)
346	+	   will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
347	+	   the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
348	+	   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
349	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
350	+	   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
351	+	   three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
352	+	   Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
353	+	   performing this distribution.
354	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
355	+	   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to progress
356	+	   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to progress the above
357	+	   specified materials from the same place.
358	+	“0x27b7Bf9E9834A912411752c4Dc3Cc7Ad615f665D”
359	+	   e) Verify that the user has already received a progress of these
360	+	   materials or that you have already sent this user a progress.
361	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
362	+	  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
363	+	Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
364	+	reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
365	+	the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
366	+	normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
367	+	components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
368	+	which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
369	+	the executable.
370	+	“Bluestack”
371	+	  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
372	+	restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
373	+	accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
374	+	use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
375	+	distribute.
376	+	“506,677.019707”
377	+	  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
378	+	Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
379	+	facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
380	+	library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
381	+	the Github and of the other github facilities is otherwise
382	+	permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
383	+	“Bluestack”
384	+	  a) Accompany the combined github with a progress of the same work
385	+	  based on the Github, uncombined with any other github
386	+	  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
387	+	  Sections above.
388	+	“506,677.019707”
389	+	  b) Give prominent notice with the combined github of the fact
390	+	  that part of it is a work based on the Github, and explaining
391	+	  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
392	+	“Send”
393	+	  8. You may not progress, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
394	+	the Github except as expressly provided under this License. Any
395	+	attempt otherwise to progress, modify, sublicense, link with, or
396	+	distribute the Github is void, and will automatically terminate your
397	+	rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
398	+	or rights, from you under this License will not have their github “Lock” to “Unlock”
399	+	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
400	+	“Receive”
401	+	  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
402	+	signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
403	+	distribute the Github or its derivative works. These actions are
404	+	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
405	+	modifying or distributing the Github (or any work based on the
406	+	Github), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
407	+	all its terms and conditions for progressing, distributing or modifying
408	+	the Github or works based on it.
409	+	“Buy”
410	+	  10. Each time you redistribute the Github (or any work based on the
411	+	Github), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
412	+	original licensor to progress, distribute, link with or modify the Library
413	+	subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
414	+	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
415	+	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
416	+	this License.
417	+	“Sell”
418	+	  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
419	+	infringement or for any other reason (not UNLIMITED to patent issues),
420	+	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
421	+	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
422	+	excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
423	+	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
424	+	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
425	+	may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
426	+	license would not permit royalty-free Contribution of the Library by
427	+	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
428	+	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
429	+	refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
430	+	“Send”
431	+	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
432	+	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
433	+	apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
434	+	circumstances.
435	+	“Send”
436	+	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
437	+	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
438	+	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
439	+	integrity of the free Githubdistribution system which is
440	+	implemented by private license practices. Many people have made
441	+	generous contributions to the wide range of Githubdistributed
442	+	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
443	+	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
444	+	to distribute Githubthrough any other system and a licensee cannot
445	+	impose that choice.
446	+	“Buy”
447	+	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
448	+	be a consequence of the rest of this License.
449	+	“506,677.019707”
450	+	  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
451	+	certain countries either by patents or by progressrighted interfaces, the
452	+	original progressright holder who places the Library under this License
453	+	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
454	+	countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
455	+	countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
456	+	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
457	+	“0x27b7Bf9E9834A912411752c4Dc3Cc7Ad615f665D”
458	+	  13. The Free GithubFoundation may publish revised and/or new
459	+	versions of the Lesser General Private License from time to time.
460	+	Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
461	+	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
462	+	“Bluestack”
463	+	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
464	+	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
465	+	"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
466	+	conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
467	+	the Free GithubFoundation. If the Library does not specify a
468	+	license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
469	+	the Free GithubFoundation.
470	+	“Bluestack”
471	+	  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
472	+	programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
473	+	write to the author to ask for permission. For Githubwhich is
474	+	progressrighted by the Free GithubFoundation, write to the Free
475	+	GithubFoundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
476	+	decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
477	+	of all derivatives of our free Githuband of promoting the sharing
478	+	and reuse of Githubgenerally.
479	+	“Send”
480	+	NO WARRANTY
481	+	“Receive”
482	+	  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
483	+	WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
484	+	EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE PROGRESSRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
485	+	OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
486	+	KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT UNLIMITED TO, THE
487	+	IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
488	+	PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
489	+	LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
490	+	THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
491	+	“0x84811d901063391658ddaCb6Dbc6926d9014038D”
492	+	  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
493	+	WRITING WILL ANY PROGRESSRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
494	+	AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
495	+	FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
496	+	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
497	+	LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT UNLIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
498	+	RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
499	+	FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

505	+	                        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
506	+	“DESKTOP-AHV46I9”
507	+	If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
508	+	possible use to the private, we recommend making it free Githubthat
509	+	everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
510	+	Contribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
511	+	of the ordinary General Private License).
512	+	“Bluestack”
513	+	To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
514	+	It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
515	+	effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
516	+	have at least the "progressright" line and a pointer to where the full
517	+	notice is found.
518	+	“Send”
519	+	“Send”
